h2. Installation

h3. Auto installation

The auto install file is a work in progress, it isn't well tested and doesn't have much error handling. If you find any errors or have any ideas to make this script better let me know or fork, fix and submit a pull request. 

Usage:
@bash < <( curl https://github.com/twe4ked/dotfiles/raw/master/bin/install.sh )@

h3. Manual install (Read comments carefully)

To install, in terminal navigate to your home folder and run @git clone http://github.com/twe4ked/dotfiles.git .dotfiles@ to pull down these files.

Next, open your @~/.profile@ in a text editor and add the following at the bottom. If you don't have a @~/.profile@ simply create one and it will automatically be run by terminal.app when each time you run it.

<pre><code># Contents of ~/.profile
if [ -e ~/.dotfiles ]; then
  . ~/.dotfiles/config
fi</code></pre>

Setup symlinks for .irbrc @ln -s ~/.dotfiles/lib/irbrc .irbrc # Setup .irbrc symlink@ (command must be run from your home folder)

Remove @~/.zshrc@ and replace with a symlink to the custom version:
@ln -s ~/.dotfiles/zsh/zshrc .zshrc # Setup .zshrc symlink (command must be run from ~/)@

h2. Update

h3. Config

h3. Prompt

What you have to look at all day.

h4. Bash

<code>[~/.dotfiles (git-branch)] » user@hostname</code> (bash)

h4. Zsh

<code>[~/.dotfiles] » user@hostname</code> (zsh) <code>(rvm) ± (master*) 1+ [19:30] ⚡</code>

export minimal_prompt=true

<code>~/.dotfiles » user@hostname</code> (zsh) <code>rvm ± master* 1+ ⚡</code>

The ⚡ symbol changes colour based on battery levels.
1+ is the number of git stashes
user@hostname only displays when user = root or connected over ssh

h2. Other interesting things

@m path/to/project@
If no arguments are supplied open the current folder with TextMate

@o path/to/project@
Use 'o' instead of 'open' (o ~/Sites will open the sites folder), if no arguments are supplied open the current folder,

If you added a @.notes@ file to any directory, the contents of that file will be output when you cd into the directory.

h3. Restart Passenger or Pow server

@rp@ looks for a tmp directory, if there is no tmp directory it prompts you to create one, once it finds a tmp directory it touches tmp/restart.txt to tell passenger or pow to restart.

h3. Hints

There is a random hint taken from lib/hints.txt inserted into the motd each time it is run. You can show all hints by running the following alias:
@alias hints='cat ~/.dotfiles/lib/hints.txt' # Show hints@

h3. Bash specific

* Ignore case in auto complete
* Removes the bell
* Automatically show completion without double tab-ing

h3. Github function

Supply a third argument to specify what folder you want to project to be cloned into

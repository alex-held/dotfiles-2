h2. Installation

To install open your @~/.profile@ in a text editor and add the following at the bottom. If you don't have a @~/.profile@ simply create one and it will automatically be run by terminal.app when each time you run it.

<pre><code># Contents of ~/.profile
if [ -e ~/.dotfiles ]; then
  . ~/.dotfiles/bashrc
fi</code></pre>

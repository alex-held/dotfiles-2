h2. Installation

To install, in terminal navigate to your home folder and run @git clone git@github.com:twe4ked/dotfiles.git@ to pull down these files.

Next, open your @~/.profile@ in a text editor and add the following at the bottom. If you don't have a @~/.profile@ simply create one and it will automatically be run by terminal.app when each time you run it.

<pre><code># Contents of ~/.profile
if [ -e ~/.dotfiles ]; then
  . ~/.dotfiles/bashrc
fi</code></pre>

Setup symlinks for .irbrc @ln -s ~/.dotfiles/lib/irbrc .irbrc # Setup .irbrc symlink@ (command must be run from your home folder)

*zsh specific*
Setup symlinks for my.zsh-theme @ln -s ~/.dotfiles/zsh/zsh-theme my.zsh-theme # Setup my.zsh-theme symlink@ (command must be run from ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes)
@ln -s ~/.dotfiles/zsh/zshrc .zshrc # Setup .zshrc symlink (command must be run from ~/)@

I'm also using "oh-my-zsh":http://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh - A community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration.
